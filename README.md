# 👋 Hi, I'm Ali Aldemir

**Senior Software Developer | .NET & JavaScript Architect | AI-Driven Systems**

I design and build scalable, production-grade software systems with a strong focus on clean architecture, performance, and real-world impact.

I’ve led web development teams on AI-based projects (including MetaEcu), building intelligent systems that improve complex operational performance using modern backend and frontend technologies.

I enjoy working on:

* Distributed systems & microservices
* Identity & authentication architectures (JWT, OAuth, Keycloak)
* AI-assisted engineering workflows
* High-performance APIs
* Clean, maintainable backend and frontend architectures
